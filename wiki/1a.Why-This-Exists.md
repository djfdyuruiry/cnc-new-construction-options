I have always been obssessed with C&C since playing it in all it's low res glory on the PS1 many years ago, eventually playing the PC releases over the years. This game is nearly 30 years old now (as of Aug 2025) and the general vibe of the game is a retro joy to behold, the same goes for the source code and all it's 1994 quirks. My main setup was always the C&C Gold edition patched with Nyergud's 1.06 patch, which contains essential enhancements.

I made an in-depth mod for mods for the C&C Remastered Collection when it was released on Steam: [[TD] ðŸ›  NCO ðŸ›  (RULES.INI ðŸ“ƒ & Lua Scripting âš™)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147631402)

Whilst this mod was a alot of fun I now want to combine it and Vanilla Conquer to achieve similar aims to projects like:

- TRX: github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX (Tomb Radier)
- R.E.L.I.V.E: https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing (Abe's Oddysee)

These took retro classics and reverse engineered and revamped them to work flawlessy on modern systems, adding a bunch of configurable enhancements as well. They also make the games pop and add alot of fun features that speak to the fans, often referencing lore and recognisable in-jokes.

Vanilla Conquer has done the hard work of making a cross-platform standlone game engine decoupled from the Remastered Collection. I will use this as a base to bring in the lessons of my NCO mod to make a similar project to TRX/R.E.L.I.V.E
