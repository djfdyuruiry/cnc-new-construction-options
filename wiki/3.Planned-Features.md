This page records what features I plan to implement in the future. This is all very lose, I will prioritise this list later - nothing is final.

## General

- Make some opinionated technical choices to improve devops experience (building/packaging)
- Add a automated installer for fetching data files from online ISO sources (since these are available as freeware)
	- Essentially automating: https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Installing-VanillaTD and https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Installing-VanillaRA
	- Have options to choose your mode (Demo, DOS, Full)
	- Should support \*nix (Linux, MacOSX) and Windows (maybe `pwsh`)

## Tiberian Dawn

- Configuration via INI files for easy customization (authentic C&C modding experience)
	- Bring RULES.INI up to the same level as Red Alert
- Option to use YAML files instead for modern comforts
- Make the Scenario Editor usable
- Move strings out to a config file (.ENG etc. files)
  - Use locale files
- Event handling using Lua scripts
- Slowly move select game logic out of the core engine
- New scripting APIs to access more game engine functionality
- Ability to control scenario flow from Lua scripts, similar to OpenRA
- Simple mod loading system
- Ability to replace files gradually and add new ones, similar to original MIX file logic
- Comprehensive documentation and tools for modders
- Strong API documentation (Lua, INI, YAML etc.)
- Good mocking tools to make testing complex scenarios and mods easy
- Attempt to keep compatbility where possible with original material
- Old formats for maps, media files etc. should not have breaking changes
- New functionality should replace or enhance old logic, in a opt-in manner

## Technical changes

Alot of these are behind the scenes or DevOps oriented changes, these aren't really for people who just want to play the game or build mods.

- Use `vcpkg` to source dependencies automatically
