Each commit message should The Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary

Types:
 - feat: A new feature
 - feat!: A feature which has breaking changes
 - fix: A bug fix
 - docs: Documentation changes
 - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
 - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
 - perf: Performance improvements
 - test: Adding or refactoring tests
 - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Examples
 - `feat(tiberian-dawn)!: make Kane die in SCG15`
 - `fix: correct normal difficulty credits for HUMVEE`

By following this convention, we maintain a clean and informative project history.
