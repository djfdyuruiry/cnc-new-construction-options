# Project Vision

The main target will be a standalone `Tiberian Dawn` engine, with a view to move on to `Red Alert` when there are working enhancements to port from `Tiberian Dawn`.

Eventually I want to also want to support using this repo as a mod for C&C Remastered Collection as that is popular.

My vision for `Tiberian Dawn`:

- Users can customize their C&C experience without modifying C++ code
- Tweaks and enhancements are immerisive, they surface in game as UI menus
- Low level control is available for nearly all aspects of the game engine via config files
  - Anything currently stored in source code, binary files, hidden in MIX files etc. should be made available in plain text format
- Static limits imposed by the original source code are removed (no cap on Unit types, Music tracks etc.)
- Combine the best of old tools and engine changes to give modders the ability to make as many changes as possible
- Patches from `Vanilla Conquer` are synced in when possible
