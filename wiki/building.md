# Building

If you are want to be brave and try building this yourself, please refer to the original Vanilla Conquer guide: [Vanilla Conquer GitHub](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Compiling-Vanilla-Conquer)

Use the `nco-tiberian-dawn` cmake preset, like this: `cmake --workflow --preset nco-tiberian-dawn`
