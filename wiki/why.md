# Why

I made a mod for the C&C Remastered Collection when it was released on Steam: [[TD] ðŸ›  NCO ðŸ›  (RULES.INI ðŸ“ƒ & Lua Scripting âš™)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147631402)

It changed Tiberian Dawn in the following ways:

- A great level of control over the game engine
- Brought `RULES.INI` for Tiberian Dawn up to the standard of Red Alert
- Added Lua scripting
- Merged in changes from popular Quality of Life mods and enhancements (A* path finding, unit rallying etc.)
  - _Whilst keeping them configurable and optional_
- Added enhancements to improve gameplay experience (Better skirmish AI)

--- 

Whilst this mod was a alot of fun I now want to achieve similar aims to projects like:

- TRX: github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX (Tomb Radier)
- R.E.L.I.V.E: https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing (Abe's Oddysee)

These took retro classics and reverse engineered and revamped them to work flawlessy on modern systems, adding a bunch of configurable enhancements as well.

Vanilla Conquer has done the hard work of making a cross-platform standlone game engine decoupled from the Remastered Collection. I will use this as a base to bring in the lessons of my NCO mod to make a similar project to TRX/R.E.L.I.V.E
