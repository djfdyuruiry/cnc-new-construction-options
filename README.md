# ðŸ›  New Construction Options ðŸ› 

C&C New Construction Options is a fork of [Vanilla Conquer](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer) with goals to enhance the gameplay and modding experience for `Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn` & `Command & Conquer:Red Alert`. 

This project aims to provide an out-of-the-box experience faithful to the original games while giving users unprecedented control over customization and enhancements through in-game menus, INI file configuration and Lua scripting.

There are no builds yet available for you to try - I am scoping out what this project will be.

As EVA would say: `NOT READY`

## Project Vision

The main target will be `Tiberian Dawn`, with a view to move on to `Red Alert` when there are working enhancements to port from `Tiberian Dawn`.

My vision for `Tiberian Dawn`:

- Users can customize their C&C experience without modifying C++ code
- Tweaks and enhancements are immerisive, they surface in game as UI menus
- Low level control is available for nearly all aspects of the game engine via config files
- Static limits imposed by the original source code are removed (no cap on Unit types, Music tracks etc.)
- Combine the best of old tools and engine changes to give modders the ability to make as many changes as possible
- Patches from `Vanilla Conquer` are synced in when possible

## Key Features (Planned)

- Configuration via INI files for easy customization (authentic C&C modding experience)
  - Option to use YAML files instead for modern comforts
- Event handling using Lua scripts
  - Slowly move select game logic out of the core engine
- New scripting APIs to access more game engine functionality
  - Ability to control scenario flow from Lua scripts, similar to OpenRA
- Simple mod loading system
  - Ability to replace files gradually and add new ones, similar to original MIX file logic
- Comprehensive documentation and tools for modders
  - Strong API documentation (Lua, INI, YAML etc.)
  - Good mocking tools to make testing complex scenarios and mods easy
- Attempt to keep compatbility where possible with original material
  - Old formats for maps, media files etc. should not have breaking changes
  - New functionality should replace or enhance old logic, in a opt-in manner

## Why and How

I originally published a mod for the C&C Remastered Collection when it was released on steam: [[TD] ðŸ›  NCO ðŸ›  (RULES.INI ðŸ“ƒ & Lua Scripting âš™)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147631402)

How it changed Tiberian Dawn:

- A great level of control over the game engine
- Brought `RULES.INI` for Tiberian Dawn up to the standard of Red Alert
- Added Lua scripting
- Merged in changes from popular Quality of Life mods and enhancements (A* path finding, unit rallying etc.)
  - _Whilst keeping them configurable and optional_
- Added enhancements to improve gameplay experience (Better skirmish AI)

---

Whilst this mod was a alot of fun and popular enough on Steam I really wanted to achieve similar aims to projects like:

- TRX: github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX
- R.E.L.I.V.E: https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing

These took retro classics and reverse engineered and revamped them to work flawlessy on modern systems, adding a bunch of configurable enhancements as well.

Vanilla Conquer has done the hard work of making a cross-platform standlone game engine decoupled from the Remastered Collection.

I will use this as a base to bring in the lessons of my NCO mod to make a similar project to TRX/R.E.L.I.V.E
