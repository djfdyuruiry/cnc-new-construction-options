# ðŸ›  New Construction Options ðŸ› 

C&C New Construction Options is a replacement game engine for  `Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn` & `Command & Conquer:Red Alert`. It's goals are to enhance the gameplay and modding experience.

This project aims to provide an out-of-the-box experience that looks and feels like the original games while giving users unprecedented control over customization and enhancements through in-game menus, INI file configuration and Lua scripting.

> This project is a fork of [Vanilla Conquer](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer)

## Project Vision

The main target will be a standalone `Tiberian Dawn` engine, with a view to move on to `Red Alert` when there are working enhancements to port from `Tiberian Dawn`.

Eventually I want to also want to support using this repo as a mod for C&C Remastered Collection as that is popular.

My vision for `Tiberian Dawn`:

- Users can customize their C&C experience without modifying C++ code
- Tweaks and enhancements are immerisive, they surface in game as UI menus
- Low level control is available for nearly all aspects of the game engine via config files
  - Anything currently stored in source code, binary files, hidden in MIX files etc. should be made available in plain text format
- Static limits imposed by the original source code are removed (no cap on Unit types, Music tracks etc.)
- Combine the best of old tools and engine changes to give modders the ability to make as many changes as possible
- Patches from `Vanilla Conquer` are synced in when possible

## Contributing

I am not actively seeking any contributions, but feature requests and any feedback are always welcome. Since I work on this project in my free time, please just record what you can on GitHub by raising issues and I will respond where I can.

## Why

I made a mod for the C&C Remastered Collection when it was released on Steam: [[TD] ðŸ›  NCO ðŸ›  (RULES.INI ðŸ“ƒ & Lua Scripting âš™)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147631402)

It changed Tiberian Dawn in the following ways:

- A great level of control over the game engine
- Brought `RULES.INI` for Tiberian Dawn up to the standard of Red Alert
- Added Lua scripting
- Merged in changes from popular Quality of Life mods and enhancements (A* path finding, unit rallying etc.)
  - _Whilst keeping them configurable and optional_
- Added enhancements to improve gameplay experience (Better skirmish AI)

--- 

Whilst this mod was a alot of fun I now want to achieve similar aims to projects like:

- TRX: github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX (Tomb Radier)
- R.E.L.I.V.E: https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing (Abe's Oddysee)

These took retro classics and reverse engineered and revamped them to work flawlessy on modern systems, adding a bunch of configurable enhancements as well.

Vanilla Conquer has done the hard work of making a cross-platform standlone game engine decoupled from the Remastered Collection. I will use this as a base to bring in the lessons of my NCO mod to make a similar project to TRX/R.E.L.I.V.E
