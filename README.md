# ðŸ›  New Construction Options ðŸ› 

C&C: New Construction Options (NCO) is a replacement game engine for `Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn` & `Command & Conquer:Red Alert`. It's goals are to enhance the gameplay and modding experience.

This project aims to provide an out-of-the-box experience that looks and feels like the original games while giving users unprecedented control over customization and enhancements through in-game menus, INI file configuration and Lua scripting.

> This project is a fork of [Vanilla Conquer](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer)
